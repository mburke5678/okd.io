## Let's share news and useful information with each other

We look forward to sharing news and useful information about OKD **in this blog** in the future. 

You are also invited to participate: share your experiences and tips with the community by creating your own blog articles for okd.io.

Here's how to do it:

* Fork the repository [https://github.com/openshift-cs/okd.io](https://github.com/openshift-cs/okd.io)
* Create a new file in the source/blog directory
* The filename must have this format: 

    ```
    yyyy-mm-dd-<title of your blog article (lowercase)>.html.markdown

    yyyy = Year (four digits)
    mm = Month (two digits)
    dd = Day (two digits)

    e.g.:
    source/blog/2021-03-07-my-first-article.html.markdown
    ```
* The date must not be in the future !
* Each article must contain a header section like this one:

    ```
    ---
    title: <THIS TITLE WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE BLOG>
    date: 2021-03-07  <- THIS DATE MUST EXACTLY MATCH THE DATE IN THE FILENAME
    tags: blog  <- CHOOSE ONE OR MORE TAGS (COMMA SEPARATED)

    ... GITHUB MARKDOWN SYNTAX ...
    ```
* Test your changes locally. This [README.md](https://github.com/openshift-cs/okd.io) file will tell you how to do that.
* Create a pull request, if your article is ready to be published.
