## The OKD Working Group is hosting a virtual workshop on testing and deploying OKD4

On March 20th, [OKD-Working Group](https://groups.google.com/g/okd-wg) is hosting a [one day event](https://hopin.com/events/okd-testing-and-deployment-workshop) to bring together people from the OKD and related Open Source project communities to collaborate on testing and [documentation of the OKD 4 install and upgrade processes for the various platforms](https://github.com/elmiko/okd-deployment-configuration-guides) that people are deploying OKD 4 on as well to identify any issues with the current documentation for these processes and triage them together.

The day will start with all attendees together in the ‘main stage’ area for 2 hours where we will give an short welcome and describe the logistics for the day, give a brief introduction to OKD4 itself then walk thru a install deployment to vSphere using UPI approach along with a few other more universal best practices such as DNS/DHCP server configuration) that apply to all deployment targets.

Then we will break into tracks specific to the deployment target platforms for deep dive demos with Q/A, try and answer any questions you have about your specific deployment target's configurations, identify any missing pieces in the documentation and triage the documentation as we go.  

There will be 4 track break-out rooms set-up for 3 hours of deployment walk throughs and Q/A with session leads:

- vSphere/UPI - lead by Jaime Magiera (UMich) and Josef Meier (Rohde & Schwarz)
- Bare Metal/UPI - lead by Andrew Sullivan (Red Hat) and Jason Pittman (Red Hat)
- Single Node Cluster - lead by Charro Gruver (Red Hat) and Bruce Link (BCIT)
- Home Lab Setup - lead by Craig Robinson (Red Hat) and Sri Ramanujam (Datto)

Our goal is to triage our existing community documentation, identify any short comings and encourage your participation in the [OKD-Working Group](https://groups.google.com/g/okd-wg)'s testing of the installation and upgrade processes for each OKD release.

This is community event NOT meant as a substitute for Red Hat technical support.
